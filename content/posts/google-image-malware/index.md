What started with a simple image search for "Skippers hat" quickly turned into investigating a clever malware 
distribution network utilizing Google image results, which is somehow linked to a group of hardcore vegan twitter bots.
The hat at the entrance of the rabbit hole was innocent enough:

{{< figure src="pic1.png" width=250 >}}

However when I clicked on the result I was taken to this page:

{{< figure src="pic2.png" width=500 >}}

A few things about this page interested me:

1. It's the wrong bloody hat.
2. The URL appeared to be a blog post: https://milvarusso.com/blog/seven-days-at-katathani-phuket-beach-resort/
3. Visiting that URL without clicking through Google images takes you to a pretty normal looking site about travelling 
   around Thailand. Not the place you'd expect to find a vector drawing of a skippers hat
4. The domain name differed from the one listed on the image result page: Google thought the image existed on 
   `phonebookofgrenoble.xyz` but I was sent to `milvarusso.com`
