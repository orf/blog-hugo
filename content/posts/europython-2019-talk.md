Two years ago I [set out to refactor the rather crufty autoreloader implementation](https://github.com/django/django/pull/8819)
in Django. I remember thinking that there is no way that this can be **that** hard. Boy, was I wrong.

I haven't blogged about this contribution to Django as I was waiting for my EuroPython talk on the subject to be 
uploaded to YouTube. And now that it's up I can be lazy and just embed it below rather than writing a whole post 
on the subject!
