I discovered an XSS flaw in a website a month ago and reported it to the owners. As a thank you they sent me a hat, a rather large american sized t-shirt and a pair of "DeFeet" socks (guaranteed to stay cooler and drier than any other brand). I didn't expect them to ship something like that overseas for a fairly simple issue, but it was nice that they did.

If you want something more bankable for finding an issue with a website then there are hundreds of sites that offer cash for vulnerabilities, called "Bug bounty programs". I found a [list of such sites](https://bugcrowd.com/list-of-bug-bounty-programs/) and picked one at random to see if I could find anything and after half a days work I discovered [a high importance issue](https://bugs.launchpad.net/mahara/+bug/1211758) which would have netted me $500 if it were not for the fact that the [bug bounty program ended late last year](https://mahara.org/interaction/forum/topic.php?id=4923). The issue I reported did however get its own CVE number ([CVE-2013-4429](https://www.mail-archive.com/debian-bugs-dist@lists.debian.org/msg1165716.html)) which is pretty cool. 

Bug bounty programs can be a nice bit of side income if you have some spare time, but always make sure that they are *currently* running a program.

The loot:
